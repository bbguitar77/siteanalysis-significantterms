    <h3>Data analytics and fraud detection</h3>
    <p>
      Stripe has a lot of data problems to tackle, ranging from fraud algorithms to understanding how people are using Stripe. Our data sources include everything from a user clicking around the Stripe web interface to a consumer making a purchase on that user’s website, and we’re always building better ways of discovering signals in the seeming chaos.
    </p>


    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>
      Our major external-facing applications are the Stripe web interface and the API. We move quickly, deploying code many times a day. We iterate rapidly, but we also spend time carefully thinking through the edge cases of our products and making sure that they work very well.
    </p>

    <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
      Infrastructure encompasses everything below the application layer. Most of the work here is building software that enables the API and web interface. Examples include finding and removing performance bottlenecks, building a framework for stream processing, and server architecture and administration.
